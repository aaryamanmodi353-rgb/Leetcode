//the loop continues

//just sorting it and matching the current num and last num if it matches simply return it
//the last element is returned if no element is found in between or at the start

//take two variables and if the number is not stored in second one then the number is stored in the previous one
//if the number come again then it is deleted from the previous one and stored in the second one
//if the number appears thrice then it is tried with the previous one and due the second variable storing the number it could not be stored in previous one
//delete the number from the second one
//so the box is empty now
//this process continues till it found the required number
